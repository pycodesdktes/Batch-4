In Python, an image is just a two-dimensional array of integers. So one can do a
couple of matrix manipulations using various python modules in order to get
some very interesting effects. In order to convert the normal image to a
sketch, we will change its original values and assign its values similar to grey, in
this way a sketch of the input image will be generated. 

Working:
First we install the libraries required for project. Import all required modules (Numpy, tkinter,
OpenCV). Open the message box and add any Image as input. Then check the shape of
image. Convert image in black and white format using cvt colour function . Convert in image
detection format using colour BGR2HSV function . Convert in inverse form. Convert in
gaussian form using gaussian blur. Convert in gray format. Display sketch
